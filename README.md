# 🍽️ Cafeteria Recommendation System

A smart **Cafeteria Recommendation System** that suggests food items based on **calorie values and user preferences**.  
This project helps users choose healthier and suitable meals using basic machine learning and data analysis concepts.

## 📌 Project Description

The Cafeteria Recommendation System analyzes food items along with their calorie information and recommends dishes based on user input.  
It is designed to demonstrate practical use of **machine learning, data preprocessing, and user interaction** in a real-world scenario.

## ✨ Features

- 🥗 Recommends dishes based on calorie intake  
- 📊 Uses structured food dataset  
- 🤖 Machine learning based recommendation logic  
- 🧮 Calorie-aware food suggestions  
- 👩‍💻 Simple and user-friendly interface  
- 🎯 Suitable for beginners  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit (for UI)
